# Every Component from Refactoring UI

I decided to try and recreate every screenshot in the wonderful Refactoring UI book by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger (which you should go and buy [here](https://www.refactoringui.com), or AT LEAST read the first two free chapters - it's very good) who are the creators of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

This is NOT a rip off of their component library and is just me setting myself a publicly visible front-end challenge. I wouldn't recommend actually using any of these in production, in case that wasn't obvious already.
